====== IDSAPI Plugin for DokuWiki ======

Just copy the idsapi folder in your dokuwiki plugin folder and activate it.

The "idsapi" plugin has a dependency on the "tag" plugin (See below). 

The tag plugin allows the addition of tags to docuwiki pages.
Clicking on the tags shows a page which lists all docuwiki pages which have that tag.

Installing the plugin extends the tag plug so that list of matching pages is followed by a list of items from the IDS KS OpenAPI.

For more information on the OpenAPI see http://api.ids.ac.uk
To set up an OpenAPI key, visit http://api.ids.ac.uk/accounts/register

The query sent to the OpenAPI is a free text search.


All documentation for the Tag Plugin is available online at:
